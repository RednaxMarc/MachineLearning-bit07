    "#  Face recognition through Eigenfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to have a good performing model for face recognition using Eigenfaces. This technique was often used in the earliest of computer vision techniques to perform face recognition.\n",
    "By now, Eigenfaces have been replaced by techniques based on convolutional neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a dataset that is already split up into a training and test set. The faces are coming from 50 different people and each person has 15 pictures original data: http://www.anefian.com/research/face_reco.htm\n",
    "\n",
    "Some preprocessing has already been performed like cropping and rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the filename of each picture, the persons ID can be determined. E.g. person22_15.jpg is the 15th picture of the 22th person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals of this exercise:\n",
    "* Read in the images and extract the ID of the person from the filenames\n",
    "* Convert the image to black and white\n",
    "* Scale the images to the same size (150x110)\n",
    "* Transform the data so the images are converted to a single array of all pixel values\n",
    "* Convert the faces to eigenfaces using PCA\n",
    "* Train different types of classifiers on the PCA data, also perform some hyperparameter tuning and/or ensemble learning\n",
    "* Test and compare the classifiers"
